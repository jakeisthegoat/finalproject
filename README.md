# Statistics 184 - Final Project
## Matt Bubb and Jacob Adams

COVID-19 Data Analyzation

Our task for this final project was to come up with visualizations and data summarizations from chosen data sources based on a research question of our choice. Although this topic could be anything we wanted, we thought it would be extremely valuable and relavant to the world today if we found data about the current pandemic plaguing our world: The Novel Coronavirus, more commonly known as COVID-19. We did not come up with a research question, but rather a research idea. The whole idea surrounding COVID-19 cases and social distincing rules is that the virus spreads at an exponential rate. Because of this, our research idea was to find commonalities between the spread of COVID-19 and exponential growth. We put our data science, statistical reasoning, and information visualizations skills to use in this project in hopes that people can get a better grip on how dangerous this virus is because of how fast it spreads. Finally, we have all of our files with data sources in this repo, so feel free to explore this repo as you please. Thanks!
